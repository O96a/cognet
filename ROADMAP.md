## 🛠️ Development Practices

### Daily
- Commit code frequently
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation
- Check progress against roadmap

### Weekly
- Review progress
- Adjust priorities if needed
- User testing (when applicable)
- Team sync (if team)

### Bi-Weekly
- Update milestones
- Review metrics
- Plan next sprint
- Demo progress

---

## 📝 Notes

### Flexibility
This roadmap is a guide, not a contract. We'll adjust based on:
- What we learn during development
- User feedback (beta and post-launch)
- Technical challenges
- Opportunities that emerge

### Prioritization
If we fall behind, we cut features, not quality:
1. Core 8-stage cycle (must have)
2. Beautiful UI (must have)
3. Auto-pilot mode (should have)
4. Advanced features (nice to have)

### Documentation
As we build, we document:
- Architecture decisions → ARCHITECTURE.md
- Design patterns → DESIGN-SYSTEM.md
- Progress → MILESTONES.md
- API changes → API.md
