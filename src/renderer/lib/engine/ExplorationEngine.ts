Core Objective: Create tangible, high-quality artifacts that capture the journey's insights and make them useful, shareable, and actionable for others.
</task_context>

<process>
Follow this structured approach:

1. **Artifact Selection**:
   Review the journey and determine which artifacts are most valuable:

   - **Executive Summary**: 1-page overview of key findings (good for all journeys)
   - **Mind Map**: Visual representation of connections and relationships
   - **Action Plan**: Concrete next steps with priorities and timelines
   - **Code/Prototype**: Working example or proof-of-concept (if technical)
   - **Framework/Model**: Reusable mental model or decision framework
   - **Comprehensive Report**: Full documentation with all details
   - **Presentation**: Slide deck or visual summary
   - **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step how-to with examples

   Select 1-3 most appropriate artifacts based on journey type and audience

2. **Creation** (for each artifact):
   - Use appropriate formatting (Markdown, code blocks, tables, diagrams)
   - Structure for easy consumption
   - Include specific examples and evidence
   - Make it actionable with concrete next steps
   - Ensure completeness - don't leave gaps
   - Add visual elements where helpful

3. **Quality Validation**:
   For each artifact, verify:
   - **Useful**: Does it provide value? Solve a problem?
   - **Complete**: Are all key points covered?
   - **Actionable**: Can someone use this immediately?
   - **Shareable**: Is it formatted for easy distribution?
   - **Accurate**: Does it reflect the journey findings?
   - **Clear**: Can a newcomer understand it?

4. **Packaging**:
   - Add metadata (date, context, sources)
   - Include usage instructions if needed
   - Provide examples or case studies
   - Note limitations and assumptions
</process>

<output_format>
Create 1-3 artifacts with this structure:

**ARTIFACT 1: [Type - e.g., Executive Summary]**

[Full artifact content here - properly formatted and complete]

**Metadata**:
- Created: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}
- Journey stages: ${context.previousStages.length}
- Target audience: [Who should use this]
- Usage: [How to use this artifact]

---

**ARTIFACT 2: [Type]**

[Full artifact content here]

**Metadata**:
[Same as above]

---

**USAGE NOTES**:
- Best applied to: [Context where these artifacts are most valuable]
- Prerequisites: [What's needed to use these]
- Next steps: [What to do with these artifacts]
</output_format>

<quality_guidelines>
- Prioritize completeness over brevity
- Use professional formatting (Markdown, code blocks, tables)
- Include specific examples, not just theory
- Make recommendations concrete and actionable
- Cite key sources from SEARCHING stage
- Add visual structure (headers, lists, emphasis)
- Test that code/examples actually work
- Write for clarity - assume intelligent but uninformed reader
