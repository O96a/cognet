/**
 * Quality Scoring Service
 *
 * Evaluates stage output quality using Claude Haiku for fast, cost-effective scoring.
 * Implements self-reflection and continuous improvement by assessing 6 quality dimensions:
 * - Completeness: Did it address all required elements?
 * - Depth: How thorough was the analysis?
 * - Specificity: Concrete examples vs vague generalizations?
 * - Actionability: Can someone use this immediately?
 * - Coherence: Logical structure and clarity?
 * - Novelty: New insights vs obvious information?
 *
 * Scores are 0-10 per dimension, with overall average. Stages scoring < 6.0 are
 * flagged for revision with specific improvement suggestions.

<instructions>
1. Score each dimension 0-10
2. Identify 2-3 specific strengths (what was done well)
3. Identify 2-3 specific weaknesses (what could be improved)
4. Provide 2-3 concrete improvement suggestions
5. Determine if revision is needed (overall score < 6.0)
